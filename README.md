# Intro to Data Wrangling with data.table

## Your Instructors
Julia Ellingwood and Renato Franco

## Materials
RPub version of slidedeck here: http://rpubs.com/jellingwood-ftw/829410

## Session Content
- **Background on data.table** what it’s for, who’s behind it, and how does it fit into the tidyverse
- **Intro to data.table objects and syntax**
- **Data manipulation with data.table** how to subset, extract, summarize, group, etc
- **An in-class exercise**

## Main Learning Objectives
- You will learn the advantages of data.table over other data wrangling tools, and compare its functionality with dplyr.
- You will be able to create data.table objects and use data.table syntax to subset, filter, extract, compute, and group your dataset.
